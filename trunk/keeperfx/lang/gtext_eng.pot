msgstr ""

#: guitext:8
msgid "Greedily done, Keeper. Now, you need to turn some of your dungeon into a Lair. Lairs are where creatures rest and recover. The area your imps just mined out would be an ideal spot for some creatures to lurk. Select the Lair icon from the Rooms Panel."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:9
msgid "Dig a tunnel that connects to the Portal to the north. Portals appear on the map as flashing squares, until they are claimed. Creatures only use Portals claimed by a Keeper. Your imps claim a Portal as soon as it connects to your dungeon."

msgid "You have not yet built a Treasure Room. Until you build this room, you will be unable to pay any creatures. Only imps give their loyalty freely. No other creatures will serve you unpaid."

msgid "Your first minion has arrived. It's a giant Fly. It can spit corrosive vomit at your enemies and its wings grant the hideous insect the speed to intercept the most nimble trespassers."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:15
msgid "A Beetle has scuttled into your realm. It's tough enough to absorb a lot of damage. Like most creatures, Beetles require food. Dig out a new area, select the Hatchery icon and create your Hatchery. Tasty snacks will soon emerge from its enchanted soil."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:16
msgid "Imps fortify your walls to prevent intruders tunnelling in. If you want to create more imps, go to the Research Panel, select the Imp icon and left click anywhere in your dungeon. Each Imp you create costs more than the previous one."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: guitext:21
msgid "Your work here is done. Now there is no-one to prevent you from obliterating this nauseating realm and expanding your empire into a neighbouring land. Nice."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:22
msgid "You require more Imps. Use the Create Imp spell to conjure them into your domain. Remember, each Imp you create is more expensive than the last."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:23
msgid "When Imps have no other orders, they run around reinforcing your dungeon.  Fortified walls keep out intruders. Rooms with reinforced walls make your creatures feel more at home and heroes more terrified."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:24
msgid "Possess creatures by choosing the Possess spell from the Research Panel and left-clicking on the creature you want to control. Right-click to leave the creature again."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:25
msgid "Remember the lessons you learned in Brana Hauk. You must build a Treasure Room, a Lair and a Hatchery and you will need to claim a Portal. Build rooms in squares of at least nine tiles to increase the efficiency of the room."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:26
msgid "You will need to make your creatures stronger. In a Training Room, your creatures can hone their fighting skills, gain new abilities and learn more powerful spells."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:27
msgid "Your plan proceeds smoothly, keeper. Allow your Imps time to fortify the walls of your dungeon. This increases the efficiency of rooms and repels would-be invaders."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:28
msgid "The Training Room attracts ever more ferocious creatures, such as Demon Spawn. Build it and they will come."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:29
msgid "To train creatures, drop them in the Training Room. The number that occasionally appears above a creature's head indicates how much gold it has cost for that creature to train."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:30
msgid "You can train creatures more rapidly by slapping them as they work out in the Training Room."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:31
msgid "Heroes are already on their way. Make sure your creatures are well trained and ready for the attack. The heroes you will face in this realm are tougher than those you met beneath Brana Hauk."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:32
msgid "Harder the heroes may have been but they were obviously no match for your forces."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:33
msgid "The heroes are on their way. Make sure your creatures are well trained and ready for the attack."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:34
msgid "Congratulations. You have conquered the enemy hordes."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:35
msgid "Build a dungeon with a Treasure Room, a Lair, a Hatchery and a Training Room. Make sure they're all big enough. Cramped conditions do nothing for the morale of your minions."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:36
msgid "The time has come to build a Library. Libraries are where new devices, room designs and magic spells are researched. Make a Library at least as big as the other rooms. Researchers like quiet too, so try to build your Library off the side of a corridor."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:37
msgid "Your new Library will attract creatures like Warlocks, who are interested in researching magic and dungeon designs. These evil mages are real bookworms, as well as being magically proficient themselves."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:38
msgid "That's a fine collection of parchments and tomes you've assembled. Most creatures can engage in research but Warlocks make the best and keenest researchers. Stupid Trolls have trouble holding books the right way up and sometimes even chew the pages."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:39
msgid "The scent of arcane knowledge has lured a greedy Warlock into your dungeon. Don't forget to train your Warlocks occasionally. Their spell casting abilities make them fine long range fighters."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:40
msgid "The first wave of attackers lie hacked to pieces on the floor and give your domain that lived in feeling but it surely won't be long before their kin launch another assault."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:41
msgid "You meet with success yet again, Keeper. All those corpses will keep your Hatchery's topsoil fertile. They also serve as warnings to other foolhardy adventurers, of course."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:42
msgid "All is quiet again. Use this time to ready yourself for the next attacks. The enemy is only regrouping. It is not yet defeated."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:43
msgid "Is that Imp playing football with a decapitated head? Stay alert, Keeper."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:44
msgid "Now would be an excellent time to train a Warlock."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:45
msgid "Already your research bears fruit. The Speed Creature spell has been perfected. Cast it on a creature and observe the dramatic increase in its speed. The effect wears off after a while."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:46
msgid "Build up your dungeon with the rooms available to you and claim the Portal nearby but do not yet venture north. Powerful adversaries lurk there. It would be wiser not to disturb them until you are prepared."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:47
msgid "Clever research has given your Imps the engineering skill to build Bridges. You will need Bridges to cross some of the more hazardous underworld terrain."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:48
msgid "A study of dungeon designs reveals that Workshops manufacture essential furniture, such as Doors and Traps. If your Workshop occupies a square of at least nine tiles, its mere presence will lure the underworld's finest artisans into your dungeon."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:49
msgid "To manufacture Traps and Doors in your Workshop you will need to assign creatures to it, by dropping them into the room. Manufactured items can be selected from the Workshop Panel as soon as they're ready."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:50
msgid "When your troops are sufficient in number and have had some training, lead them north and crush any who oppose you."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:51
msgid "You will have to find a way to cross the river of molten lava that bars your way."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:52
msgid "The enemy's Dungeon Heart throbs before you. Assemble your minions nearby and administer the coup de grace."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:53
msgid "A Troll has joined you. Skilled in the craft of manufacturing, trolls are best employed doing dark deeds in your Workshop. They don't complain about the hours, because their labours keep them away from combat."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:54
msgid "With the enemy Dungeon Heart in ruins, you have trounced the once proud opposition. Rule your new domain with terror and loathing, for a laugh."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:55
msgid "Your Workshop has created a Wooden Door. Placed in a corridor, it restricts access to the enemy. Your creatures may pass freely. Lock or unlock Doors by clicking over them with the left mouse button."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:56
msgid "Your Workshop has produced a Poison Gas trap. Position it and, when an intruder sets it off, it will envelop the area in deadly vapours."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:57
msgid "You have researched the Call to Arms spell. The first time you cast it, your creatures gather around a banner created by the spell. Cast it again in a target area. Call to Arms only costs gold when it's targetted beyond your territory."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:58
msgid "Another Keeper controls this underworld realm. His dungeon lies to the north. If you are to entice creatures to work for you instead of him, you will have to build a more magnificent dungeon. Get on with it then."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:59
msgid "You have slain your rival. His defeat is a testimony to your clever dungeon design. You have the makings of a Dungeon Keeper worthy of the name."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:60
msgid "A Bile Demon chooses to side with you. Bile Demons demand large Lairs and ample Hatcheries. These corpulent monstrosities attack somewhat unconventionally."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:61
msgid "Your loyal researchers have perfected the Sight of Evil spell. Cast it on an unexplored area and it will be revealed to you for a moment."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:62
msgid "You have claimed a Prison. Select imprison from the Information Panel and your creatures subdue their foe, at which point your imps drag the bodies off to a cell. Prisoners who die of starvation may rise again as Skeleton warriors for you to command."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:63
msgid "Your dedicated librarians have designed a Guard Post. Place a Guard Post in a strategically important area and assign creatures to occupy it by dropping them there."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:64
msgid "A Spider has joined your dungeon. They are natural enemies of Flies, so endeavour to keep them apart. Overcoming such obstacles will temper your mettle - whatever that means."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:65
msgid "It's time to mete out the ultimate punishment to a keeper who dares to challenge you for this corner of your subterranean empire. The price of failure shall be oblivion."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:66
msgid "How satisfying it is to see an enemy Keeper's dungeon crumble and his power dissipate. There'll be no controversy over this year's hall of infamy nomination."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:67
msgid "You have claimed a Torture Room. Place captive heroes and creatures into this chamber of horrors to convert them to your supremely evil way. Alternatively, place your own creatures within the room whenever disciplinary measures become necessary."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:68
msgid "You have finally constructed a dungeon impressive enough to attract a Dark Mistress. You must discipline these wicked wenches frequently. They respond particularly well to a good slapping."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:69
msgid "Your manufacturers have created a Braced Door. If security matters, you can be sure when you buy a Braced Door. You couldn't be certain with only a curtain and a hole in the wall is no help at all."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:70
msgid "Your researchers have devised a spell that unleashes the energy of a thunderstorm on the target of your choice. Select the spell, aim at a hostile creature and flash-fry him with a Lightning Strike."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:71
msgid "You have manufactured a powerful Lightning Trap. Try it out. It's bound to give someone a shock."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:72
msgid "It appears you have arrived in the middle of a raging battle. Perhaps it would be wise to stay out of the way until you are strong enough to eliminate both sides."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:73
msgid "An Orc warlord joins you and brings with him the plans for building a Barracks. In this room you can form creatures into teams."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:74
msgid "I think I hear the clanking of plate armour. Yes, the Lord of the Land has finally roused himself from the fireside to find out where all his loyal servants have gone."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:75
msgid "You have turned local heroes into something of an endangered species, now make the enemy Dungeon Keeper extinct."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:76
msgid "You have prevailed, Keeper. The bodies of your enemies litter the most forlorn alcoves of your domain, in tribute to their futile efforts to keep you at bay."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:77
msgid "Seek out the one who would be your rival in this region of the underworld. Explain the concept of early retirement to him. On the other hand, string him up. It's in the only language he understands."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:78
msgid "You have researched the power of Invisibility. Cast it on a creature to hide it from enemy eyes."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:79
msgid "The Protect Creature spell has been researched at last. Cast it on a creature to increase its toughness."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:80
msgid "That's another enemy successfully written off. The defenceless inhabitants of the land above bow down before your depraved presence. As if that will save them..."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:81
msgid "Researchers have found instructions for building a Temple to the dark gods. Sacrifice creatures in the Temple's pool to receive gifts from these gods. You might have to experiment with the offerings you make. The dark gods are not easy to please."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:82
msgid "This realm is ruled by four arrogant Wizards who think they've got everything under control, because their feeble magical power impresses the locals. But you're not from these parts..."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:83
msgid "Well, you're done down here. Time to introduce yourself to the locals and re-organise their nice little lives."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:84
msgid "Behold, you have summoned a Horned Reaper. Try not make it angry. You'll fail, because everything makes a Horned Reaper angry but at least try to make sure that everything near it is an enemy creature when it finally goes ballistic."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:85
msgid "Your researchers have concocted a Disease spell. Cast it on enemy creatures and watch the affliction spread like the plague."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:86
msgid "A Vampire has risen from your Graveyard, nourished by the souls of the dead which have been brought here. You have to suck up to Vampires or they go off in a huff, but they're extremely powerful and fearsome underlings to have in your employ."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:87
msgid "You have researched the Graveyard. Your Imps will drag corpses here to rot... And possibly to rise again as Vampires, ready to do your bidding. That's style."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:88
msgid "You have manufactured an Iron Door. It's a formidable barrier. Use it well."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:89
msgid "Powerful creatures inhabit a cave south of here. There's a party of heroes between you and them but, if you reach them and convert them to your side before they join the other keepers, you will be unstoppable, unless you do something stupid."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:90
msgid "You have overcome all resistance to your rule, O despicable one. It's time to flex the old misery muscle on the pathetic inhabitants of the land above."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:91
msgid "You have a manufactured a Boulder Trap. Place it in a corridor and howl deliriously as it rumbles inexorably towards unwary trespassers."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:92
msgid "With typical brilliance, you have researched the Cave-In spell. Use it to block off passages and repair dungeon breaches. Interestingly, the rockfall will crush to death any creatures caught beneath it."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:93
msgid "Your tireless librarians have researched the Scavenger Room. Creatures placed within a Scavenger Room will lure their kin from other dungeons and the outside world, into your domain."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:94
msgid "Your great wealth has bought the loyalty of a passing Dragon. They are fickle creatures. Keep your eye on this one."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:95
msgid "A Hell Hound has been lured to your domain by your Scavenger Room."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:96
msgid "The other two Keepers in this region have put aside their differences for the moment and joined forces, in an effort to destroy you. That's almost a compliment. Kill the creeps."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:97
msgid "You have won a magnificent victory, Master. You have a talent for twisted mercilessness that makes other Keepers look well behaved by comparison."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:98
msgid "You have discovered a devastating magical power. Target it against a creature to transform a fearsome monster into a clucking chicken. Marvellous."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:99
msgid "Your manufacturers have built an Alarm Trap. It will warn you of your enemies' approach and summon nearby creatures to deal with the intruders."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:100
msgid "You have created a Magic Door. These are almost impregnable to all but magical attacks. I recommend sealing off your Treasure Room or Dungeon Heart."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:101
msgid "Elsewhere in this fiery realm you have a rival Keeper to contend with. I advise extreme antisocial behaviour on your part."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:102
msgid "Notch up another victory, most malicious one. You have another land to add to your dismal collection."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:103
msgid "Your annihilation of the first wave has met with the approval of a pack of demons from the fifth plane of hell. Train your creatures and prepare for another battle. You're attracting quite an audience."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:104
msgid "The enemy are upon us. I'm just telling you in case you were having a doze."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:105
msgid "All the heroes are dead, which is as it should be. This land and all its spoils are yours. May I suggest that you waste everything?"
msgstr ""

#: guitext:106
msgid "If lands had legs this one would be on its knees. Its desperate inhabitants are preparing a full scale attack on your dungeon. It will be an ideal opportunity to practise unspeakable evil on a massive scale. Go for it, master."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:107
msgid "Your latest discovery is the Word of Power Trap. When activated, the trap triggers an expanding ring of fire that incinerates anything caught in its area of effect. What a scream that should be."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:108
msgid "The Hold Audience spell has been researched. It will immediately teleport all of your creatures back to your Dungeon Heart. Let's hope you never need it."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:109
msgid "You can't swing a cat for Dungeon Keepers fighting over the destiny of this region. It should fall to you to settle the disagreement once and for all."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:110
msgid "Your researchers have discovered the devastating Chicken spell. Cast it on any creature to instantly transform the target into poultry. It's a fowl weapon."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:111
msgid "So, now you have a spell that turns fortified walls to dust. It's expensive to cast and it's also possible that your enemies possess the same magic power. This could still turn out to be one of those days."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:112
msgid "Only the Lord of this Land stands between you and hectares of desolation and woe. I bet you can't wait to meet him."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:113
msgid "Your continued success makes me sick. Thank you, your wickedness."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:114
msgid "You seem to have started a trend. Two other Dungeon Keepers also have designs on this dark domain. Expect no quarter from your rivals."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:115
msgid "Can you see how vulnerable one of your opponents has become? Then kill him."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:116
msgid "I spy a keeper with hardly any creatures left under his control. I spy a Keeper who's about to die."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:117
msgid "This ancient dungeon possesses great archaeological significance. This simply means there should be some interesting treasure worth stealing. Now that's what I call practical archaeology."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:118
msgid "Your librarians have learned a spell that can break through fortified walls. Give them a slap for not learning it earlier."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:119
msgid "One of your opponents has developed a spell that can break through fortified walls. Typical. Be on your guard."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:120
msgid "You have developed the Armageddon spell. That's quite a name to live up to. Make sure you're the most powerful force in the region before casting it."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:121
msgid "You will not find any easy path through this region. You will have to fight hard to gain any advantage. But, if you intend to rule the world, you've simply got to get through days like this."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:122
msgid "Your manufacturers have crafted the Lava Trap."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:123
msgid "Your location is already known to the heroes of this land. They have moved quickly to mobilise their forces against you. It's pathetic. They deserve to have their heads impaled on lances for such impudence."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:124
msgid "You've upset the local Lord. He's on his way right now. Shall I alert the media?"
msgstr ""

#: guitext:125
msgid "The heroes of this realm possess treasures of great power. Obviously, these should belong to you. I'm certain you will settle the matter of their ownership in your own way."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:126
msgid "It appears you have a rival. Another Keeper believes he is more ruthless and evil than you. We shall soon see."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:127
msgid "This ancient realm is rich in magical artifacts. Go forth and plunder."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:128
msgid "The guardians of this realm are asleep at the moment. Attack them as soon as you can or they'll be breakfasted, wide awake and inherently more difficult to slaughter."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:129
msgid "If you should encounter hero patrols, ensure that none of their number escape. Otherwise your presence will be revealed and then you will be in trouble."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:130
msgid "You're taking forever over this. Attack and destroy the heroes' stronghold soon, preferably before hell freezes over."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:131
msgid "Enemy reinforcements have arrived. So what? Let's hear it for more killing."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:132
msgid "The heroes of this realm have prepared for your coming by building an underground stronghold of their own. Who do they think they are? Sorry, master, that was a rhetorical question."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:133
msgid "You are about to face the greatest challenge yet to your evil aspirations. Here it comes, ready or not."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:134
msgid "Three other Dungeon Keepers, each as evil and powerful as you, have expanded their empires into this realm. Ultimately, only the one who rules the underworld can conquer the realms above."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:135
msgid "This realm is begging to be plunged into darkness. The Avatar himself has a castle here. Another Keeper also seeks his soul. This could get messy."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:136
msgid "You have destroyed the Avatar's castle but your rival has already taken the Avatar prisoner. Be that as it may, only the Keeper with the blackest heart can destroy this legendary hero, so ransack your rival's dungeon and take the prize."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:137
msgid "The Avatar has been resurrected by loyal lieutenants in hiding. But their act has revealed them to us, here in this realm. Now the Avatar rallies all those who would stand against you. It's time you gave this self-righteous oaf a proper kicking, master."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:138
msgid "Powerful magic permeating through the rock from the realm above prevents a dungeon from being constructed here. You will have to conquer this realm another way."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:139
msgid "Possess this Dragon to help you negotiate the fiery pits but be prepared to transfer your soul to a more appropriate creature when the situation demands it."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:140
msgid "Possess the Vampire below. Should you succeed in killing every hero in this region, the Vampire will accompany you to the realm beyond."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:141
msgid "These Imps have all turned rogue and therefore must die. The speed with which you accomplish their destruction will determine your fitness for greater tasks ahead."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:142
msgid "Tempus fugit, Keeper. You have been warned."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:143
msgid "You have failed. Perhaps you're not the harbinger of doom the forces of darkness were hoping for."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:144
msgid "You are indeed a twisted soul, master. You made the Imps extinct with such panache that not one but two Dark Mistresses have devoted themselves to helping you achieve your next goal. You may proceed to your next conquest."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:145
msgid "You must have lightning reflexes to complete the task ahead of you. Kill these Imps as quickly as you can."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:146
msgid "Half your allotted time has elapsed."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:147
msgid "You are out of time. That was a shocking performance."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:148
msgid "It is done. Tiny heaps of charred flesh smoulder where Imps once stood. You certainly had your finger on the pulse this time. The dark gods will send you a Giant to help you conquer the next realm."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:149
msgid "You have no gold left. It pays to keep your head in such a charged environment."
msgstr ""

#: guitext:150
msgid "You have been called to this realm to punish a horde of revolting Bile Demons by crushing them with Boulder Traps scattered around the perimeter of the dungeon. You have very little time, so rock and roll!"
