
Skirmish AI - Development task list (so I can remember what I am doing)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Points are separated in categories, and are further subdivided into implementable tasks.


Bugs (things that should work by now that don't):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(All fixed for now, more will come)

Early game:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MDig for portal.
1.a. Planner needs to know why portal is good. Simulation of creature gain via portal ownership must be added.
1.b. Planner must be able to instruct digging to portal. Potentially, this could be done by the take room decision, or build room decision.
1.c. Top level module must parse dig to portal decision (however it is done), and perform it.
(A lot of these issues are shared with AI planning for acquisition of neutral rooms in general. On the other hand, taking neutral rooms or hero rooms is more problematic than taking portals in general due to how levels could be scripted)

2. Dig for gold, at appropriate times.
2.a. Gold needs to be reserved for actions that are queued up. If those actions are carried out or canceled, reservation is canceled.
2.b. Gold must be introduced into planning.
2.b.i. Room costs must be considered (probably presume worst case here).
2.b.ii. Creature pay days. How many in advance that must be reserved should depend on amount of gold we think we can easily dig. Either implement relation explicitly or try to get planner to understand by removing creatures if gold cannot be paid.
2.b.iii. Potential to dig to gold areas unintruded. If we risk contact with enemy (without already having it) and we are weaker, don't allow digging to said gold area.
2.b.iv. To prevent AI deciding to dig out all gold areas at once, worker capacity must be considered.
2.c. Plan decision to dig to gold area (and implicitly building treasure chamber) must be introduced.

3. Build treasure rooms specifically close to gold, esp. to gems.
3.a. This should probably not be handled by planner except as a special cost for entering a new gold area.
3.b. Room layout with treasure room may be difficult and probably requires extension of room layout module.

4. Create imps via spell if applicable (what to do in "good keeper"-campaign?)
4.a. Introduce plan decision. Implement appropriately in planner and top level module.

5. Consider how to decide when/how large to build lair and hatchery.
5.a. They should probably remain as plan buold/take room decisions (for creature attraction and maximizingv build order rate of gain).
5.b. They must also be sized approriately for dungeon inhabitants.
5.c. In particular, hatchery should be placed close to production rooms (e.g. library, workshop). Top level and room layout modules need to handle this.


Mid game:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Late game:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Various minor issues:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prevent from building certain rooms through planning via a simple bit mask AND, if not creature kind is attracted to them.

Check that enough imps are available before considering to build rooms in parallel.


Architectural issues:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planner needs to allocate nodes in chunks probably - deallocation takes forever right now.
