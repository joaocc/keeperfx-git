1. Introduction

KeeperFX allows you not only adding your own custom-made levels, but also merging the levels into
 a campaign and configuring levels to be played in certain order for the campaign.
 
A campaign consists of the following elements:
a) Levels to be played
b) Land view images
c) Mentor description voices
d) Campaign configuration file
e) Custom configuration files (optional)

You will have to prepare all of these items to make a campaign. You could also use land view images
 from another campaign, or skip the mentor voices - but without these elements, your campaign
 may lose on playability.

This guide will try to show you how to create all the elements of KeeperFX campaign. 

2. Creating levels

You can create levels in any of the editors:
a) Official DK Level Editor
b) ADiKtEd - Another DK Level Editor
c) UnDED - A simple editor, not recommended

Then, you have to prepare scripts for the levels. Scripts are TXT files which store instructions
 regarding the behavior of the level and its players. Search for "Dungeon Keeper Script Commands
 Reference" - this document will be very helpful for creating the script.

There are also some helper tools for creating scripts - visit keeper.lubie.org for details.

Remember to playtest every level to make sure it is balanced, isn't too hard and it is possible
 to win. You don't need a campaign to play a single level - just put it into "levels" folder,
 and start it from "Free play levels" menu inside KeeperFX. 

3. Creating land view

The land view is the place where you're selecting the level to play. The land view consists of:
a) a background picture over which you can move the view
b) an ensign which represents the next level to play (actually, there may be many ensigns visible at once)
c) a frame picture which indicates that you're looking on the world from a distant tower of some kind

Also, a mentor voice which describes the next level can be heard in the land view
 screen. Preparation of the mentor audio files will be explained later. For now,
 we will focus on the graphics files needed to make custom background for the screen.

3.1. Drawing or selecting pictures

What you need to start is a series of land view pictures showing the "progress
 of evil" after beating every level.
To be exact, you need:
a) Land view picture at start of the campaign (whole green; this is used in
 special cases, ie. multiplayer screen)
b) Land view picture to be shown before every level (the place where ensign
 will be placed may be marked somehow, ie. be brighter)
c) Land view picture at end of the campaign (whole red; shown when the whole
 campaign is beaten)

The a) picture can be identical to the first picture of b) series, but you may
 also make it a bit different - ie. a bit lighter.

It is up to you what will be on these pictures. Usually, the pictures are showing
 the same landscape - first picture shows a green, happy island, and the last
 one shows red, dead island flowing with lava. But if you have another idea for
 your campaign - you can use any theme you want.

While selecting photos or drawing your pictures, make notice of their resolution
 - the images in KeeperFX need to have size 1280x960 pixels. Also, make sure
 the important part of the picture isn't very close to its border - otherwise,
 the area you wanted to be visible may prove to be covered by a frame tower picture.

3.2. Preparing pictures for KeeperFX

After the pictures look OK, you have to write them in a format which will be accepted
 by tools we will use. The format is 24-bit PNG. All modern graphics programs can
 support that format. To be precise, you need:
- Color depth: 24-bit
- Resolution: 1280x960 pixels
- Format: PNG

3.3. Converting pictures to a format understood by KeeperFX engine

Currently, KeeperFX supports only 8-bit color (256 colors) in land view pictures.
 But it won't be enough to just convert your image into 8-bit color space. This
 is because KeeperFX also needs the resulting colors to match colors used in tower
 frame, ensign pictures and even mouse cursor.

Luckily, KeeperFX contains tools which would allow you to convert a PNG file into
 the 8-bit format automatically.

You will need the following tools:
a) png2bestpal - a tool to select a best palette from series of 24-bit PNG files
b) pngpal2raw - converter between PNG and RAW/HSPR file which can use colors from existing PAL file

These tools are part of KeeperFX and everyone who compiles KeeperFX (ie. creates nightly builds)
 can also build them. You should be able to find a compiled version somewhere, and if not,
 you can recompile them by yourself.

If your first land view image file is "rgmap00.png", and the frame is "viframe.png", then
 you can use the commands below to generate files for KeeperFX:
png2bestpal -o "rgmap00.pal" -m "color_tbl_landview.txt" "rgmap00.png" "viframe.png"
pngpal2raw -o "rgmap00.raw" -p "rgmap00.pal" -f raw -l 100 "rgmap00.png"
pngpal2raw -o "viframe00.dat" -p "rgmap00.pal" -f hspr -l 50 "viframe.png"
 
The first line generates a PAL file which stores best colors to be used for the 8-bit bitmaps.
It requires additional file, which defines colors used by ensigns and mouse pointers.
The file is named "color_tbl_landview.txt" and you can find it in KeeperFX source.
Second line generates RAW file from "rgmap00.png", and third line generates DAT file
 from "viframe.png".

3.4. Placing files into correct folders

From the commands above, you should now have PAL,RAW and DAT file for every of your levels.
Place all these files into one folder - they are ready to be used in KeeperFX.
It is a custom to end name of the folder which stores land view files with "_lnd".
If you will do that, other people won't get confused when looking at your files.

Every of the resulting RAW files should have size of exactly 1228800 bytes - if it's
 different, that means you've got bad resolution in the source PNG file.

Every of the resulting PAL files should have 768 bytes.

The DAT files can have various sizes, as they use RLE compression for alpha channel.

If you wish, you can compress the DAT and RAW files with RNC (Rob Northon Compression).

4. Creating mentor description

Mentor description of a level consists of two parts: the one played before you start
 the level, so-called "good" description, and the one after the level is beaten,
 praising the victory - called "evil" description. 

4.1. Writing a script

First, you will need to write a script - a simple text file would be enough. Just
 write what the mentor should say for every level. It may be related to the story,
 or may be more generic - it's up to you. Writing it down will make it easier to
 record the voice, but also will allow other people to translate your script to
 other languages and prepare translated version of the campaign (if they will want
 to do that for some reason - it happens sometimes). Just remember to publish your
 script somewhere within the campaign.

4.2. Recording

You may use any recording software and hardware you want. You don't need a studio,
 or an evil voice - the style of the recording is up to you. Just make sure it isn't
 hard to understand the words. If you never used any voice recording software, try
 Audacity - it's a very good tool, and it's open-source.

4.3. Converting to KeeperFX format

After the speeches are recorder, you may try normalizing them or applying dynamic
 compression - most audio tools have such options. This will make sure the sound are
 not too silent. Forcing users to turn up their volume is a very bad practice.

Then you have to write them in a format which will be accepted by KeeperFX.
 The format is 24-bit ADPCM. Most modern audio programs can support that format.
 To be precise, you need:
- Channels: mono
- Bit depth: 16-bit
- Sample rate: 22050 Hz
- Format: WAV (Microsoft WAVE)
- Codec: ADPCM (Microsoft ADPCM)

4.4. Placing files into correct folders

Place all the generated WAV files into one, separate folder. It is a custom to end
 name of the folder which stores speech files with language shortcut, ie. "_eng".

5. Preparing campaign configuration file

Now as we have all the required files, we need to bind them together with a campaign
 configuration file. The configuration file does not physically bind all the files
 into one, but it contains locations and names of all the other files used in the
 campaign. Creating the configuration file will make our new campaign appear in the
 "New game" menu.
 
You can base your CFG file on any of the pre-existing files. Note that the one which
 contains most verbose comments is "keeporig.cfg". Read all the descriptions,
 and replace level names, level numbers and folder names with the ones you created
 for your campaign.

Good luck!
