REM Briefing

REM ********************************************
REM On the surface, Loveyheart is a tranquil haven,
REM bunnies frolic, flowers grow, and everyone
REM is at peace with each other.
REM Below, however, an immense war has struck the
REM subterrenean underlands. The resident Keeper, days
REM before his attack on the overland, has been
REM overthrown by a sinister, equally, nay, even more so
REM evil force. This may be the work of another reign of
REM Keepers.
REM You must take care of this new threat before it
REM becomes a challange to yur own throne. Note,
REM however, that resources are low and you have been
REM given only a few rooms and spells to work with. See
REM what you can find at the previous Keeper's dungeon
REM ruins.
REM Be wary Keeper, and flush out the intruders with
REM extreme predijuice.
