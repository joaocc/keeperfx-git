Bullfrog games RNC Utilities
------------------------------

Many of games developed by Bullfrog contains compressed data files.
This include Syndicate, Dungeon Keeper, Gene Wars and other games.
The compressed files has an identifier at the beginning "RNC",
 so they are called RNC files.

Here you have RNC.EXE and DERNC.EXE, allowing you to compress
 and decompress these files.

All the Bullfrog games that I know will accept the decompressed
 version of data files, so you really don't have to recompress it.

Note that the compressor is not as perfect as original Pro-Pack,
 so it may be unable to compress some files. But all files can
 be properly decompressed.
